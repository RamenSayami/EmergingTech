# **Problem Statements:**

<p align="justify"> In the healthcare industry, accurate prediction of diseases plays a crucial role in early detection, personalized treatment, and effective resource allocation. the interpretation of medical text and accurate classification of medical images are critical tasks that have a significant impact on patient care, diagnosis, and treatment. Currently, healthcare professionals face challenges in efficiently analyzing and extracting relevant information from vast amounts of medical text and complex medical images. These texts often contain unstructured information, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights and patterns. Similarly, medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and histopathological images, present challenges in accurate classification due to their complexity and variability.

<p align="justify"> With the growing availability of healthcare data, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The problem at hand is to leverage machine learning modules to develop robust disease prediction models that utilize diverse healthcare data sources, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, optimize patient care, and improve overall health outcomes.

<p align="justify"> The aim of this project is to develop advanced techniques and methodologies to address the challenges faced in the heathcare industry such as predicting diseases, interpreting medical text and accurately classifying medical images. The purpose of addressing the problem of predicting diseases, interpreting medical text and classifying medical images in the healthcare industry is to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of healthcare processes and decision-making. By leveraging automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques, the aim is to enhance the interpretation of medical text and improve the classification of medical images, ultimately leading to better patient care and outcomes. AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, refers to the automated process of building and optimizing machine learning models without the need for manual intervention. It aims to streamline the model development process, reduce the time and effort required, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the models.
